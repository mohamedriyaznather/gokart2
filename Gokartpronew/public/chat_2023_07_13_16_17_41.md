To change the default zoom level of a web page from 50% to 100%, you can use CSS. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Open your HTML file and add a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section to define the CSS rules.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body {
            zoom: 2; /* Change the value to 1 for 100% zoom */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your web page content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

2. In the CSS code, target the `body` element and set the `zoom` property to the desired value. In this case, we set it to `2` for 200% zoom, but you can change it to `1` for 100% zoom.

By applying this CSS rule to the `body` element, the entire web page will be zoomed accordingly when it loads.

Note: The `zoom` property is non-standard and may not work in all browsers. It is recommended to use CSS3's `transform` property with the `scale` function for better cross-browser compatibility:

```css
body {
    transform: scale(2); /* Change the value to 1 for 100% zoom */
    transform-origin: top left;
}
```

This alternative approach achieves the same result but is more widely supported.
